### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on certifications in SQl, Python, and Tableau.
 
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code games through Python and utilize regressions and classifications to optimize.

 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new ways to bring a new experience to gaming with machine learning.
 
 ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining my code language usage.
 
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about current game genres and the types of successes the industry has had.
 
 âš¡ Fun fact: The simplest things are the most enjoyable.
